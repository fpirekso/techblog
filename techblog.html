			Robots Replace Humans

			In the youtube video "Humans Need not Apply", it talks about how robots are going to take over our society. They belive that in the fulture robots will replace a large portion of jobs that people have today. Robots can replace thses jobs and make things more efficient and make the production of goods cheaper. The video shows how in the future there could possibly new jobs that don't exist today becuase of the robots. Our future will be surrounded by robots.  
		</p>
		<p>
			This video is accurate about our future becuase of the convenience robots will bring. They would make everything cheaper and make good more affordable to everyone. However it would result in humans becoming lazy becuase robots are doing our jobs.

			Cameras are everywhere today. It is easy to identify anyone just because of it. Searching images online is made easy becuase there are cameras everywhere. Anyone can be recognised and can be seen online because cameras are easily accessible to anyone. Not only that but there are cameras placed everywhere in society. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Today cameras being everywhere is a terrifing thought. No matter where you go there will always be a way for someone to find you. You lose a sense of privacy becuase anywhere we go there will be someone watching you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Technology makes finding things very efficent.
			Information is extremely easy to get because of the internet. Anything that we put online can be used by anyone who is able to get it. Technology is changing our society and it is effecting how we function.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to technology everything about our world today is changing. Everything is made more easy becuase of it and when. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Today in our society almost everyone uses the internet. These websites that we vist everyday can figure out who you are. They are able to use the information you give them like your name, email, etc. They also use cookies that you leave on previous sites as well as your IP adress to know who you are. With all this information the websites you go on know who you are. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Knowing that all these websites know who you are is a terrifying thought. We start to lose a sense of privacy becuase of it. Technology is making our lives more public than they were previously.

		<p>Good Job. I agree that with you that cameras being everywhere is a terrible thought. People can get freaky with them and take pictures or record videos of you doing something stupid or embarrassing. We should be careful with what we do online because people can see all of the naughty things we do when we are alone on the internet.</p>

			By Fenty

		<p>
			I interviewd my cousin Annisa because she grew up in the early 90s and life and technology was completely different than it was today. 
		</p>
		<p class="fenty">
			Fenty: How old were you when you got your first computer?
		</p>
		<p>
			Annisa: I've had a computer when I was in elemtary school I believe. I remember it being pretty blocky and huge, especially the screen.
		</p>
		<p class="fenty">
			Fenty: What was your favorite piece of technology when they were growing up?
		</p>
		<p>
			Annisa: My favorite piece of technology growing up were the phones I've used, as time went on, it just kept evolving and able to do more stuff
		</p>
		<p class="fenty">
			Fenty: How has technology changed over your lifetime?
		</p>
		<p>
			Annisa: Technology has changed over my lifetime in that what used to need a lot of space to save so little, it's the opposite. Now, you can save so much in a small phone. It also used to be that you needed different pieces of technology for different uses, but now you can find everything you need on a small phone.
		</p>
		<p class="fenty">
			Fenty: Have the changes youâ€™ve seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or
			hurt society?
		</p>
		<p>
			Annisa: I believe the changes that I've seen in technology have very much helped society. Nowadays, you're able to grasp all the knowledge of the world in the palm of your hands. You can access any information you need, and it's much easier to stay updated with what is going on anywhere in the world.
		</p>
		<p class="fenty">
			Fenty: What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?
		</p>
		<p>
			Annisa: My greatest hope for technology is  for it to be able to work with the environment.  I hope to see that we continue evolving technology so it would save and protect the environment while continuing to help society progress with it's ability to access any information needed.
		</p>
		<p class="fenty">
			Fenty: What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?
		</p>
		<p>
			Annisa: My greatest fear for technology is that people will only focus on advancing technology and profiting from said technology that they would forget to find ways to help better the environment and the lives of the unfortunate.
		</p>
		<p class="fenty">
			Fenty: What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology?
		</p>
		<p>
			Annisa: The advice I would give to the younger generation would be, even though technology is greatly accessible to the majority, you also still need to learn how to live without it. Just take breaks sometimes and get involved in what's happening around you.
		</p>
		<p class="fenty">
			Fenty: How has technology affected your life?
		</p>
		<p>
			Annisa: Technology has helped change my life for the better. I'm a very curious person. So when I have a question about something, I can now easily reach for my phone and search it up and have the information I was looking for within seconds. It helps me for work in that I need the GPS to help me find my way around.

		<h3>Use tech for good</h3>
		<h4>Pauly</h4>
		<p>I agree with your cousin Annisa about how people seem to only be interested in profiting and advancing technology, instead of benefitting society and those who are less fortunate. I like the aesthetic of your blog. Also Annisa's comment on how people need to know how to live without technology, because it can easily be taken away from us.</p>
